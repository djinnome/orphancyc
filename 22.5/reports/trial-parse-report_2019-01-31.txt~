;;;      ---  Trial Parse Results for a non specified bacterium (Kondo 77) (Orenza)  ---
;;;
;;; This report summarizes the findings of the PathoLogic parser for
;;; the annotation files selected by the user for trial parsing.
;;; Through inspection of this report, the user can tell whether features of major
;;; importance were not recognized, possibly due to syntax errors or other
;;; problems in the annotation files.
;;;
;;; If you want to change annotation file(s) to improve their parsability, 
;;; update the files.
;;; Then, re-run the Trial Parse command.
